Make an object file of 32bits, make the following command
nasm -f elf hello.asm

Then the object file produced of 32bits must be loaded to the memory
ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello hello.o

Then execute the following command, 
./hello to execute the binary file.

Another Step is to make an object file of 64bits, while running the nasm command explicitly
nasm -f elf64 hello.asm

Then executes the following command,
ld hello.o -o hello

That produces the binary file, and then
./hello

Know the architecture type of your machine by typing:
uname -m

If you wanna know the file for architecture, then type the following:
file [file_name]
